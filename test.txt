Balade that Chaucier made.

So hath my herte caught in rémembraunce

Your beautè hool, and stedfast governaunce,

Your vertues allè, and your hy noblesse,

That you to serve is set al my plesaunce;

So wel me lykth your womanly contenaunce,
[xxvi]

Your fresshe fetures and your comlinesse,

That, whyl I live, my herte to his maistresse,

You hath ful chose, in trew perséveraunce,

Never to chaunge, for no maner distresse.
